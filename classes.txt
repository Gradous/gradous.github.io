Summer 2013
==================
15-213/15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems
Prof. Greg Kesden
Test difficulty - 9/10
HW difficulty - 8/10
Lecture enjoyability - 6.5/10
Professor rating - 7/10
Amount learned - 10/10

Learned a ton of C and system-level concepts as a whole. Since it was a summer
class, I spent probably about 20-35 hours a week combined for both homework
and watching lectures. When there was a test I might have spent up to 40 hours
the week before studying and watching lectures. Overall, despite the hard work,
it was a great class and I learned a lot.

Fall 2013
==================
14-740 Fundamentals of Telecommunications
Dr. Bill Nace
Test Difficulty - 8.5/10
HW difficulty - 4/10
Lecture enjoyability - 8/10
Professor rating - 7/10
Amount learned - 8/10

I hadn't ever taken a networking class before, so this was a great introduction.
Nace is a friendly guy, and his class was pretty easy to pay attention 
to. If you saw him present at the open house, he lectures pretty much the same
way. His homeworks were easy, but practical, and I enjoyed doing them. His
tests, however, were waaaaay different than the rest of the class. They asked
extremely specific (answer was on 1 slide only) questions, and there was no way
to predict what all would show up on the test since all previous material was
possible. It was fair though, I just didn't know how to study for it. I still
recommend it.

18-730 Introduction to Computer Security
Dr. Virgil Gligor
Test Difficulty - 9/10
HW Difficulty - 7/10
Lecture enjoyability - 4/10
Professor rating - 5.5/10
Amount learned - 7/10 and rising

I don't know if you'll have to take this specific class, because I think the
INI changed the requirement, but in essence you'll get the same material just
with a different professor (Dr. Nicolas Christin). The material is very
abstract, but the reason I said that my learned amount is "still rising" is
because the material shows up in almost every class and it makes more sense.
The tests were very difficult for me, and I had to study for a long time. I
think that's mostly due to the material. Overall, this class was the most work
for me in the fall.

14-761 Applied Information Assurance (AIA)
Chris May/Dennis Allen
Test Difficulty - 2/10
HW Difficulty - 3/10
Lecture enjoyability - 10/10
Professor ratings - 10/10, 10/10
Amount learned - 8/10

This was my favorite class in the fall. Lots of "best practices" for security,
and hardening servers was a fairly regular assignment or in-class deal. There
were some fantastic assignments, and we even got to have the instructors break
into our hardened servers and monitor how they did it (they intentionally 
allowed for the machines to not be fully up to date). Nothing was incredibly
difficult, but it was all very fun. I always looked forward to this class. If
you plan to take the forensics track, you'll take this course, but even if you
don't, it's still a good course to take. Highly recommended for sure.


Spring 2013
==================
18-731 Network Security
Dr. Nicolas Christin
Test Difficulty - 7.5/10
HW Difficulty - 6/10
Lecture Enjoyability - 9/10
Professor rating - 10/10
Amount learned - 9/10

I think this has been my favorite class overall at CMU. Lots of very excellent
material was covered, and the homeworks were practical and enjoyable. Christin
is a fantastic professor as well, very easy to understand and his slides are not
hard to interpret. There was a class project for the semester, and I showed off
some of my progress to someone at the SEI which is what I think landed me a
summer internship with the ETC at SEI. Really though, it's not an easy class,
but it's a great class. Most people would rather take SSS, but this is easily
as comparable for learning material.

14-822 Host-based Forensics
Jeff Mattson
Test Difficulty - 5/10
HW Difficulty - 4/10
Lecture enjoyability - 10/10
Professor rating 10/10
Amount learned - 7/10

This is the second class in the forensics track, and it barely loses out to AIA
in terms of enjoyment, though that may be partly due to the fact that AIA covered
a very broad array of topics. The material in this class mainly pertains to
disk image analysis. He will tell you that the course is heavy early and lighter
later in the semester; this is 100% accurate. The beginning of the semester covers
very low level stuff, so you'll be reading a lot of hex to figure out information.
However, once you get a little higher up, it becomes so much more enjoyable. Every
assignment or test is like solving a new puzzle. It never was boring for me, but
that may be because I am interested in forensics. Still, even if you don't plan
to do the forensics track, it's a great class.

14-786 Information Security Risk Analysis
Rich Caralli, James Stevens
Test Difficulty - 5/10
HW Difficulty - ?/10
Lecture enjoyability - 4/10
Professor ratings - 6/10, 6/10
Amount learned - 4/10

This is the first Heinz mini you'll have to take. It's... different. At the time
when I took the class, I was not enjoying it. However, I will say that it does
a half-decent job of covering one aspect of security policy (risk planning).
The biggest challenge of the course is figuring out how to properly interpret
the questions of the HW and tests. They're not really too hard, but you have
to not think too much or you'll actually go further than they want you to when
answering. The HW difficulty is a "?" because they often would make mistakes
when creating the quizzes on Blackboard, and you wouldn't know which questions
were wrong until the next class. Generally though, it's an OK class; I had some
conversation about information security risk in a couple of interviews so it's
not useless.

14-788 Information Security Policy Management
Dr. Rahul Telang
Test Difficulty - 5/10
HW Difficulty - 2/10
Lecture enjoyability - 2/10
Professor rating - 1/10
Amount learned - 1/10

By far, this has been my least favorite course at CMU for a wide variety of reasons.
This isn't a "I'm doing poorly in this class so I hate it" summary, but I think
there are some issues that need to be addressed for this class to be better. Mainly,
don't expect your technical knowledge to make any difference in this class. In fact,
he often says to "not think about the technical standpoint" when talking in class.
You are very welcome to just throw random statements out with no regards to accuracy
from both a technical or a policy view. This is the reason the home page of this site
is a "buzzword generator." This class doesn't even attempt to incorporate any actual
security policy into discussion, not even a little. The best way to describe this
course is to take "security" and "management" out of the course title and just
call it "Information Policy." You'll be required to take this class, so you will
most likely need to learn patience to deal with it. For the record, I had generally 
good grades in here so this opinion is mostly based on content being delivered.
