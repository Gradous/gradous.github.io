											<p>This generator was made primarily in reaction to non-technical
											 students trying to compare technical problems to real-world events.
											 Most of these comments were made with little to no regard for the 
											 severity of some of these real catastrophes, and it seemed that 
											 these students were sometimes even doing this in an attempt to 
											 imply they had more technical knowledge than they really did.</p>
											 <p>These remarks were often made casually as well, like the 
											 events were no big deal. "I think that the Target 
											 breach is a good indicator of the possibility of a cyber 9/11." 
											 "Well, I have a feeling that we'll see a cyber Pearl Harbor in 
											 the next couple of years." Even the class slides weren't spared 
											 from these buzzwords, the word "cyberhurricane" was arguably 
											 invented by these slides. Ironically, if you attempted to use 
											 "cyberhurricane" as part of an answer in your homework, you 
											 would have points taken off.</p>
											 <p>Overall, this generator isn't something that is directed at a 
											 particular student, professor, or class. And even in the group 
											 of students that often made these remarks there are some 
											 who recognized the sheer ridiculousness of such statements and 
											 avoided behaving likewise.</p>
											 <p>Buzzwords don't help anyone. With this particular case, they 
											 only add hyperbole to a situation that is far from dire. They 
											 serve no practical purpose other than to draw attention.</p>
