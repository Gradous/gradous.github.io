					<p><b><i>Dr. Bill Nace</i></b></p>
					<p>I hadn't ever taken a networking class before, so this was a great introduction.
					Nace is a friendly guy, and his class was pretty easy to pay attention
					to, if you weren't tired thanks to the time that the class is offered. 
					If you saw him present slides at the open house, he lectures pretty much the same
					way. His homeworks were easy, but practical, and I enjoyed doing them. His
					tests, however, were waaaaay different than the rest of the class. They asked
					extremely specific (answer was on 1 slide only) questions, and there was no way
					to predict what all would show up on the test since all previous material was
					possible. It was fair though, I just didn't know how to study for it. I still
					recommend it.</p>

					<p>I don't know if you'll have to take this specific class, because I think the

					with a different professor (Dr. Nicolas Christin). The material is very
					abstract, but the reason I said that my learned amount is "still rising" is
					because the material shows up in almost every class and it makes more sense.
					The tests were very difficult for me, and I had to study for a long time. I
					think that's mostly due to the material. Overall, this class was the most work
					for me in my first semester.</p>

					<p><b><i>Chris May/Dennis Allen</i></b></p>
					<p>Lots of "best practices" for security,
					and hardening servers was a fairly regular assignment or in-class deal. There
					were some fantastic assignments, and we even got to have the instructors break
					into our hardened servers and monitor how they did it (they intentionally
					allowed for the machines to not be fully up to date). Nothing was incredibly
					difficult, but it was all very fun. I always looked forward to this class. If
					you plan to take the forensics track, you'll take this course, but even if you
					don't, it's still a good course to take. Highly recommended for sure.</p>

					is a fantastic professor as well, very easy to understand and his slides are not
					hard to interpret. There was a class project for the semester, and I think it helped

					<p><b><i>Jeff Mattson</i></b></p>
					<p>The material in this class mainly pertains to
					disk image analysis. He will tell you that the course is heavy early and lighter
					later in the semester; this is 100% accurate. The beginning of the semester covers
					very low level stuff, so you'll be reading a lot of hex to figure out information.
					However, once you get a little higher up, it becomes so much more enjoyable. Every
					assignment or test is like solving a new puzzle. It never was boring for me, but
					that may be because I am interested in forensics. Even if you don't plan
					to do the forensics track, it's a great class.</p>

					<p><b><i>Rich Caralli/James Stevens</i></b></p>
					<p>This is the first Heinz mini you'll have to take. It's... different. At the time
					when I took the class, I was not enjoying it. However, I will say that it does
					a half-decent job of covering one aspect of security policy (risk planning).
					The biggest challenge of the course is figuring out how to properly interpret
					the questions of the HW and tests. They're not really too hard, but you have
					to not think too much or you'll actually go further than they want you to when
					answering. The HW difficulty is a "?" because they often would make mistakes
					when creating the quizzes on Blackboard, and you wouldn't know which questions
					were wrong until the next class. Generally though, it's an OK class; I had some
					conversation about information security risk in a couple of interviews so it's
					certainly not useless.</p>

					<p><b><i>Dr. Rahul Telang</i></b></p>
					<p>By far, this has been my least favorite course at CMU for a wide variety of reasons.
					This isn't a "I'm doing poorly in this class so I hate it" summary, but I think
					there are some issues that need to be addressed for this class to be better. Mainly,
					don't expect your technical knowledge to make any difference in this class. In fact,
					he often says to "not think about the technical standpoint" when talking in class.
					You are very welcome to just throw random statements out with no regards to accuracy
					from both a technical or a policy view. This is the reason the home page of this site
					is a "buzzword generator." This class doesn't even attempt to incorporate any actual
					security policy into discussion, not even a little. The best way to describe this
					course is to take "security" and "management" out of the course title and just
					call it "Information Policy." You'll be required to take this class, so you will
					most likely need to learn patience to deal with it. For the record, I had generally
					good grades in here so this opinion is mostly based on content being delivered.</p>

					<p><b><i>Dr. Rajeev Gandhi</i></b></p>
					<p>Probably, as of this semester, my most time-consuming class. The whole class seems
					to be designed that you will be working on labs for a long period of time. There are
					even references to the Operating Systems class in the lab documents, so it's almost
					like they are wanting to pretend they are offered similar rigor to the Operating Systems
					class. This is not quite true. It is true that you will design a kernel (in ARM), and 
					it's true that almost all your homeworks will build on each other. What is less likely to 
					be true is that you will be able to consistantly receive good help for your homework. The TAs 
					in the previous year's embedded class were constantly talked about as being some of the best, 
					but only one or two TAs were helpful for this course. Piazza posts would be either unanswered 
					or answered very poorly, and assignments were not graded until the end of the semester. The TAs 
					also would grade the tests and would subtract large amounts of points for minor mistakes -- 
					in one question, after seeing Dr. Gandhi, I received 10 points back. It was a nightmare trying 
					to get help from most of the TAs.
					</p>
					<p>
					Tests were also made in such a way that everyone was going to fail. The stats on the final exam:
					</p>
					<div class="row">
					<small><i>
						<div class="col-md-3">
							<b><p>Minimum Value 4.00</p></b>

						</div>
					</i></small>
					</div>
					<p>
					Yes, that is a 4 out of 100 on the final exam. No one in the class passed that exam. 
					This was an open-book, open-notes test. In general, the goal of these tests is to 
					beat the average. The only reason most people take this class is to fill a mostly
					unhelpful prerequisite for Distributed Systems. It's hard to be positive about this 
					class when everything is designed for you to bang your head against a wall while working.

					<p>At the time I took this course, it was a pilot class for the INI taught by 
					my summer internship employers, the Emerging Technology Center. This comes as both 
					a good and bad thing. The good thing is that they were not like typical instructors 
					and were actively focused on improving the class before it even ended. You may be 
					requested to give feedback multiple times a semester. I really like this, I think 
					that it helps a lot for making sure the class is on track. However, if you're an INI 
					students (or someone particularly technical), you will most likely not enjoy this class. 
					The assignments are subjective at best, and it seems that you're required to follow a 
					a template for presentations/papers no matter what the outcome. As "flexible" as it's 
					supposed to be, the assignments are not. There's a lot of ambiguity in the assignment, 
					which is part of the course, but there's ambiguity in dealing with the assignment ambiguity
					too. In other words, sometimes they don't give you a clear explanation of their requirements.</p>
					<p>It is worth noting, though, that this class is an incredible resume booster. Myself and 
					many classmates were asked specifically about this class on our resumes when we were interviewing.
					This isn't just government sector, it's private sector too. So if you can bear with it, it 
					may be a very good career choice. Just don't expect to enjoy it too much if you want something 
					technically in-depth.</p>

					<p>This was probably my least favorite of all the forensics classes, but
					that doesn't mean that I didn't learn anything. In fact, I got a lot more 
					paranoid about what goes on in my own network. If there's anything that 
					you should get out of this class, it's how easy it is to analyze 
					"metadata." However, don't expect a lot of help in learning anything. 
					You're going to be on your own. Keep up with the homeworks, even if he doesn't 
					grade them sometimes. You will screw yourself on the test otherwise. This class
					will teach you however much you want to get out of it.</p>

					<p>A great ending to the cyber forensics track. You really brush up on the 
					material from previous courses and put it all together in a much more advanced 
					way. It's surprising how much I remembered, as well as how much I didn't. The 
					lectures, like most CERT classes, just feel like they take a long time (because 
					they actually do), but other than that, they are really good. Very detailed and clear 
					content with professionals teaching, not academics.</p>
					<p>The very best part of the class is the final project, which is broken into 
					multiple stages to balance out the workload. Not only do I appreciate them 
					properly staging the assignment so that you can't procrastinate, I like that they 
					don't overload on the work. Plus, it's challenging stuff. You will not find 
					everything. I still found it to be one of the best assignments I ever have done.</p>

					<p>The second easiest class I had at CMU. Twice a week, I would get up and 
					just go to class. Rarely was there anything I had to prepare (except at the end). 
					I could just go and relax. I didn't even have to bring my backpack if I 
					felt like it. This class was mostly an exercise in learning to confident in 
					speaking publicly and less about communicating a point. This was valuable to 
					some people in this class for sure, though I think I got less out of it. I did 
					get to act out a scene from Step Brothers though... that was fun!</p>

					<p><b><i>Dr. Bill Nace</i></b></p>
					<p>This class is likely the hardest for me to review. I say that because I 
					could easily go on a very long rant about it (which I did a lot during the 
					semester). I'll do my best to focus for this review though</p>
					<p>First, this class is not designed for you to have any control over the 
					assignments. You don't get to pick your partner for the homework, and you are 
					also randomly assigned members to your project team. If you get stuck with 
					someone who doesn't do anything, well, tough luck. There are no consequences 
					for them. This class promotes coasting. It's possible to put in minimal effort 
					until the final comes.</p>
					<p>Second, this course needs to be vastly improved in terms of logistics and 
					quality. Everything is done via pre-recorded videos. These videos aren't even 
					updated between semesters, and there is content that needs to be redone because 
					the field has changed. There are tons of readings, some reaching over 100 pages, 
					and at least 2 and 1/2 hours (can be upwards of 3 and 1/2) of lectures to watch 
					per week. It's not enjoyable, there's no real interaction. It's very easy for 
					the course staff this way, but it's really not that good for the students.</p>
					<p>Finally, I don't like the way that things are just arbitrarily done in this 
					class. Labs? Random partner. Project? More random partners. Final? Have to make 
					a 50 or greater to pass the class. You think, "What is the point of all this? 
					This doesn't do anything to help me enjoy the class?" There will never be an 
					answer to this question. You can ask it, but there will not be something that 
					properly addresses it. Things are done this way because Bill Nace wants them 
					done that way. You have to accept that, or you will hate this class (you may 
					still hate it regardless).</p>
					<p>I do have to give credit to Prof. Nace on one really big thing. He is very 
					timely in getting back on emails, at least from my experience. He also is 
					happy to make time to meet with you on your schedule if you can't make his 
					office hours. He is genuinely interested in you learning the material, for 
					sure. However, his methods to teach you this material are not that amazing. 
					I think this course needs a lot of improvement. Overall, improving a 
					professor's teaching methods is much easier than creating a desire for him/her 
					to teach. Prof. Nace has the motivation, but needs some work in the execution 
					department.</p>

					<p>This is the one -- the ultimate do-nothing class. If you've done even the 
					slightest bit of work in Linux, this class will be a breeze for you. During the 
					semester, I did every homework but one in the first half of the class. Rarely 
					did I ever need to do anything outside of class. And you didn't even have to go! 
					He doesn't take attendance, but there is a participation grade. Even if you don't 
					go, you can still contribute on the discussion board and get your points that way. 
					As a whole... this will balance your schedule out a lot, especially when projects 
					come around. 1 hour of studying for the final turned into a 100 on the test, which 
					I did in 10 minutes. So yeah... take this class if you want to ease up your workload.</p>
